\section{Results}\label{results}
\paragraph{Clustering approach}
Our initial approach of clustering on all training data together
worked reasonably well.  When running on all 5 sample gestures and
with the HMM enabled, we got an an accuracy of 89.6\%.

However, on the same data, our cluster-matching algorithm combined with
an HMM reaches 94.6\%.  We also observed similar improvements with examples,
as seen in the data.

\paragraph{HMM}
Although we found a few examples where the cluster-matching algorithm
benefits from using a Hidden Markov Model, in most real-world examples
there is little benefit.  When running on all of the training data,
we

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}
We worked hard, and achieved very little.
